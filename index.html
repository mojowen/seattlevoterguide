                                The City Council has no authority over the development that is going on outside of city limits. However, the city can implement a smart annexation plan that ensures that the taxpayers get a return on their investment. It's vital that appropriate impact fees are assessed so that tax payers do not bear the financial burden.

                                For any entity that contracts with the city, the City Council should remove any policies that discriminate in the following areas: -- Housing, City Employment, City Contracting, Boards and Commissions, and Federal Title VI City. Beyond that, the City Council is not the right place to determine discrimination laws. The state and federal levels are where those difficult decisions need to take place.Programs and Services

If it is implemented wisely, recidivism goes down, the cost is much less, and the offender takes on most of the financial responsibility -- not the taxpayer.

                                City boundaries must be managed in regards to the needs of the city now and in 20 years. Holding city boundaries is only part of the equation, planning to meet the needs of an aging city, with diverse housing needs, and growing demands on city services need equal consideration. Infill and population density plans are crucial. All of these must be considered in conjunction with increased demands on services.

                                Limiting boundaries might be more involved than what is seen on the surface. With a change in tax structure Laurel and Lockwood could expand their boundaries and Billings would be left with stagnate growth potential. If you are thinking along the lines of infill areas this can also be complicated. First someone would want to sell property, then a developer would need to take the risk to develop, and then someone would want to live in the area.

                                There are definitely concerns over what could happen if there is unlimited expansion. The City of Billings must have the ability to provide municipal services to those areas that are annexed without creating an unnecessary financial or resource burden for those areas already within the city limits. Billings is expected to increase about 40,000 in population over the next 20 years. That’s with a 1.5 increase in population. Where that population will locate is important and careful planning to accommodate growth is important. Studies show that the millennials and baby boomers are the age groups for whom the city will need to provide services in the future. At the same time, it will be necessary to consider how we can continue to be a community that is attractive and thriving so as to cause young individuals and young families to be attracted to Billings. Undeveloped areas in the midst of us can be unattractive and an eyesore! We need to look to development of infill areas to the greatest extent possible for the benefit of all.

                                As the largest city in Montana we cannot afford to look to the past. 
Billings’ future is before us and it demands our attention. Our future is dependent upon enticing a diverse, talented work force, attractive to high tech businesses paying living wages, willing to invest in our shared future. By building a more diverse community, we attract high tech companies willing to engage the Montana work force stereotype, pay a living wage and ensure a motivated, innovative, and dedicated work force. To achieve this we must:
-        Continue to create an environmentally green city
-        Develop the city’s reputation as a diverse community
-        Ensure that all who live here have a voice 
-        Implement ‘out of the box’ ideas to conserve water and reduce or delay the need for a new water processing plant
-        Plan the city’s future foot print to include affordable housing
-        Provide more information to the voters on all issues before them to allow for informed decisions One of Billing’s strengths is its diversity which will continue to grow, our goal should be to ensure each citizen has an equal voice at the table, feels safe in their neighborhoods and has equal access to all city services.

                                Expanding jail diversification programs would be a good thing. The American Medical Association determined alcohol addiction to be a disease in 1956. Many people with addictions (drug and alcohol) require treatment of one kind or another in order to remain drug and alcohol free. There are those professionals who believe that methamphetamine is a harder addiction to break and that in-patient treatment is a must for some individuals in order for them to be successful. Most certainly, Drug Treatment Courts have been successful, in good part because those involved with Drug Treatment Courts know that they are being monitored, and that there is available to them a strong support system to help them remain drug and/or alcohol free. Helping people remain drug free is a far cheaper way to deal with the issue of addicted people than incarceration. People who are drug/alcohol free can become contributing members of society.

                                I really think Billings has more essential issues to work on. If trails and bike lanes are built using grant monies, the on going maintenance costs money and has to come from some where. Maybe bikers should have a license fee to help with the cost. Don't get me wrong, I think trails and bike lanes are great if resources were unlimited.

                                Multi-use trails and bike lanes seem to be a very popular thing and I would think that wherever possible, expansion of those would be a good thing. At the time streets are being painted for traffic needs, it makes sense that if there is adequate space for bike lanes that the addition of those could naturally occur and would require little money to do so. Multi-use trails and bike lanes are used by a wide variety of different people and wherever they can be added and there is adequate funding to do so, it makes sense.

                                The City Council cannot control subdivision growth outside the city limits. However, it is important that if subdivisions are annexed into the city, the subdivisions must pay appropriate impact fees that ensure the taxpayers of Billings aren’t footing the bill for infrastructure. Appropriate impact fees for annexation naturally make infill areas cost competitive for redevelopment, which, in turn, helps increase the tax base without expanding the service area.

                                Billings should work to limit the amount of sprawl. Expanding our boundaries via annexation increases the associated cost of delivery of city services to these areas. While growth will continue in Billings, it needs to be sustainable and efficient and not be an excessive burden to taxpayers.
